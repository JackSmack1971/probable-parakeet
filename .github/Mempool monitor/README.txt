Web3.py library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to retrieve the details of all pending transactions for a specific ERC20 contract's Transfer event.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
Web3.py library
An Infura project ID
Setup
Install Python 3.x on your system.
Install the Web3.py library using pip: pip 
install web3
Replace <INFURA_PROJECT_ID> in the code with 
your Infura project ID.
Define the contract ABI and address as per 
your requirement.
Run the code.
Description
The code connects to an Infura node on the 
Ethereum mainnet.
It defines the contract ABI and address to 
interact with.
It defines the event signature for the 
Transfer event of the ERC20 contract.
It creates a filter for the mempool to 
retrieve pending transactions for the 
Transfer event.
It retrieves the transaction hashes from the 
filter.
It retrieves the full transaction objects from 
the Ethereum node.
It prints the transaction details such as 
transaction hash, sender, recipient, and value.
