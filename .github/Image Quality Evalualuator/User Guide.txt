User Guide: Image Quality Evaluator 

Overview 

The Image Quality Evaluator program allows you 
to evaluate the similarity between an original 
image and an upscaled image by calculating a 
"grade" based on three metrics: mean squared 
error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), 
and structural similarity index (SSIM). 

System Requirements 

The Image Quality Evaluator program runs 
on the Windows operating system. 
You will need to have Python 3.6 or 
later installed on your system, along 
with the following Python packages: 

• numpy 

• math 

• tkinter 

• PIL 

• skimage

Running the Program 

To run the Image Quality Evaluator program,
follow these steps: 

• Open a command prompt and navigate to the 
directory where you extracted the program files. 

• Type the following command to start the 
program: 


python image_quality_evaluator.py 

• The program's graphical user interface 
(GUI) will appear on your screen. 

• Click the "Open Images" button to select 
an original image and an upscaled image to 
compare. 

• The program will calculate the grade based 
on the three metrics and display it in the 
"Grade" label. 

Using the Program 

To use the Image Quality Evaluator program, 
follow these steps: 

• Click the "Open Images" button to select 
an original image and an upscaled image to 
compare. 

• The program will display the original 
image in the left panel and the upscaled 
image in the right panel. 

• The program will calculate the grade based 
on the three metrics and display it in the 
"Grade" label. The grade is a number between 
0 and 1, with a higher number indicating a 
closer match between the images. 

• You can repeat steps 1-3 with different 
images to compare. 

• To exit the program, simply close the 
GUI window.

The Image Quality Evaluator program is a 
simple tool for evaluating the similarity 
between images using three common metrics. 
With its user-friendly GUI and straightforward 
operation, it is a useful tool for anyone who 
needs to compare images for quality or 
similarity.
