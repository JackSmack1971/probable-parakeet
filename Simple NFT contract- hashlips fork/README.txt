This is a Solidity smart contract named SimpleNFT that inherits from multiple interfaces and contracts from the OpenZeppelin library. It implements an ERC721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) with some additional features, including minting, pausing, and royalties. The contract is meant to be a simple NFT contract with various functionalities that can be used as a template for creating more complex NFT projects. 

Features of the SimpleNFT contract: 

• Minting: Users can mint new NFT tokens, and the contract owner can also mint tokens for specific addresses. 

• Cost: The cost of minting an NFT token can be set and changed by the contract owner. 

• Base URI and Hidden Metadata URI: The contract owner can set the base URI for the metadata of the NFT tokens and a hidden metadata URI that is used before the NFTs are revealed. 

• Mint Pausing: The contract owner can pause and resume minting of the NFT tokens. 

• Reveal: The contract owner can reveal the NFTs, which changes the token URI to use the base URI instead of the hidden metadata URI. 

• Whitelist: The contract owner can add and remove addresses from a whitelist, allowing them to mint NFT tokens. 

• Royalties: The contract owner can set the royalty percentage for each NFT token. When a token is sold, the specified percentage of the sale value is sent to the token owner as royalty. 

• Burn: Users can burn their NFT tokens. 

• Transfer: Users can transfer their NFT tokens to other addresses. 

• Vesting: The NFT tokens have a vesting period, and vested balances are calculated for each address holding tokens. The vested balance is updated on each token transfer. 

Please note that this contract uses the OpenZeppelin library, which simplifies the development of secure and audited smart contracts in Solidity.
