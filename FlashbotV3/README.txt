Ethereum Frontrunning Bot
This script is a Python implementation of an Ethereum frontrunning bot that listens for pending transactions, calculates the optimal gas price, and creates and broadcasts a new transaction to frontrun the original transaction. The bot is built using Web3.py and Infura for connecting to the Ethereum network.

Disclaimer: This code is for educational purposes only. Frontrunning is an unethical and potentially illegal activity. Using this code for real-world applications is highly discouraged.

Features
Monitors pending transactions on the Ethereum network
Calculates the optimal gas price for frontrunning based on the transaction value, sender's balance, and the network conditions
Creates and signs new transactions with the optimal gas price
Broadcasts the new transaction to the Ethereum network
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or newer
An Infura account with an API key
An Ethereum private key (for signing transactions)
Dependencies
web3.py
eth-account
eth-abi
eth-utils
You can install the dependencies using the following command:

Copy code
pip install web3 eth-account eth-abi eth-utils
Setup
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethereum-frontrunning-bot
Navigate to the repository folder:
bash
Copy code
cd ethereum-frontrunning-bot
Open frontrunning_bot.py in your favorite text editor.

Replace <INFURA_PROJECT_ID> with your Infura project ID.

Replace CONTRACT_ADDRESS and ABI with the ERC20 contract address and ABI that you want to monitor.

Replace YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY with your Ethereum private key.

Usage
Run the script using the following command:

Copy code
python frontrunning_bot.py
The bot will start monitoring the Ethereum network for pending transactions related to the specified ERC20 contract. When a new transaction is detected, the bot calculates the optimal gas price for frontrunning and creates, signs, and broadcasts a new transaction with the optimal gas price.
