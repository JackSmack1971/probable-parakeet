First, you will need to have Python 3 installed
 on your computer. 
You can check if you have Python installed by 
running the command python --version in your 
terminal. 
If you don't have Python installed, you can 
download it for free from the official Python 
website.

Once you have Python installed, you can download
the updated code from the source where it is 
stored. 
You will also need to create a configuration
file called config.ini in the same directory 
as the Python file. In this file, you should 
include your Etsy API key and region, 
as well as an expiration time for your cache. 
The configparser module is used to read this file.

The updated code uses various Python modules 
to interact with the Etsy API and perform 
market research. 
Here are some of the main features of the 
updated code and how they can be used for 
market research:

get_trending_shops: 
This function gets a list 
of trending Etsy shops and their basic 
information, such as the shop ID, user ID, 
and shop name. 
You can use this function to find popular shops
and see what types of products they sell.

get_shop_listings: 
This function gets a list of listings for a given
shop ID. You can use this function to see what 
products a specific shop sells and what their 
prices are.

get_shop_sales: 
This function gets a list of sales for a given 
shop ID. 
You can use this function to see how many sales
a shop has had and what their total revenue is.

The code also includes data classes for shops,
listings, and sales, which make it easier to 
work with the data returned by the Etsy API.

To use the code, you can call the main function
and pass in your Etsy API key and region as 
command-line arguments. 
You can also specify a Google Sheets 
spreadsheet ID and sheet name to export 
the data to a spreadsheet. 

The asyncio module is used to run the code 
asynchronously, which means that it can 
perform multiple tasks at the same time 
and is more efficient.

In summary, the updated code can be used to 
perform market research on Etsy by 
finding popular shops, 
examining their products and prices, 
and analyzing their sales data. 
With some modifications, 
the code could also be used to analyze 
other aspects of the Etsy marketplace, 
such as customer reviews or shipping times.
