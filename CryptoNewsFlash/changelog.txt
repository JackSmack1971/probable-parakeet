v2.0.0
------

- Added separate functions for fetching news from CryptoCompare, CoinPaprika, and CoinGecko APIs (CoinPaprika and CoinGecko implementations need to be added).
- Updated the `Config` class to include API keys for CoinPaprika and CoinGecko news sources.
- Modified the main function to fetch news from multiple sources by calling the respective functions and combining their results.
- Updated the `post_news` function to accept a list of news articles instead of an API key.
- Replaced the call to `get_news(api_key)` with the new `get_all_news(config)` function.
- Updated the `schedule_posting` function to call the `get_all_news(config)` function and pass the result to the `post_news` function.
- Implemented extraction of rate limit information from the API response headers.
- Updated the news fetching functions for each API to return the rate limit information along with the news data.
- Updated the `get_all_news` function to return the minimum rate limit reset value among all the APIs.
- Modified the `schedule_posting` function to use the dynamic rate limit reset value for scheduling the next job.
- Improved error handling, logging, and input validation.
- Enhanced security by using environment variables for sensitive information storage.
- Improved code modularity and reusability by refactoring code into separate functions or classes for different tasks.
